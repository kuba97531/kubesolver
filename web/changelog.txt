1.0.5 538118d (8.06.2020)
=====
- Fix a problem when some sequences were not printed. (sequences that had equivalent partial sequences to some other sequences)
- Fix a problem with moves that don't change cube state
- Add new option max-depth-after-first-match (da)
- Add option to set all options as commands rather than commmand line argument. Now it's possible to set max nunber of moves or depth in config.
Example:
set n 10 - print first 10 sequences found
set da 1 - only searcg sequences at most 1 move longer than the shortest sequence found
set d 14 - only search sequences at most 14 moves long.
